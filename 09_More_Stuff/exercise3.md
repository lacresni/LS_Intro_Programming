# Exercise 3
**What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?**

Exception handling allows managing exceptions/errors in your program.
Your program continues to execute properly after handling of the exception (if not, Ruby interpreter stops your program when an exception is raised...)

LaunchSchool definition

> Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
